Welcome to **Alan**, a competitive 2D multiplayer game where two players (Red and Black squares) race to capture tiles on a 6x6 grid. Strategy and speed decide the winner!

## 🎮 Gameplay Overview

Alan starts from a **menu** with only two buttons: **Play** and **Quit**.  
- **Play**: Starts the game  
- **Quit**: Exits the game  

In the game, players are placed on a **6x6 white grid**. Every **5 seconds**, one random square is highlighted. The first player to reach this square captures it, turning it into their own color (Red or Black).  

- Each captured square increases that player’s score by **1**.  
- The game continues until all **36 squares** have been captured.  
- The player with the most squares at the end wins.  
- If both players capture an equal number of squares (e.g., **16–16**), the game ends in a draw.
